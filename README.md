# Homicide-Data-Exploration
Learning Crime Trends and Demographic Insights




## Overview
In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to homicide cases in the United States. EDA is an essential phase in understanding the structure, patterns, and nuances of data, which would then drive further analytical or modeling efforts.

## Dataset Selection
I chose a specific dataset that piqued my interest. The details of the dataset, including its source and content, can be found in the project repository.

## Tools and Methods
For this project, the following tools and methods were utilized:

- **Tool of Choice**: Microsoft Power BI for data analysis and visualization, along with Python and Streamlit for developing the web application.
- **Exploration Techniques**: A combination of data visualization, statistical analysis, and data cleaning was applied to uncover insights from the dataset.

## Project Files
This project repository contains the following key files:

- **homicide-dataset and Power BI Dashboard.zip**: This is a zip file containing a csv file - the dataset we analyzed for our EDA and the Power BI file of the interactive dashboard.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: You can access the interactive Power BI dashboard by following this [link](https://app.powerbi.com/links/nQHepu1iwr?ctid=392ba85e-a1c8-4f5c-85ec-251bc6d10f96&pbi_source=linkShare). Feel free to explore the visualizations and insights.
- **homicide.zip**: This file is used in the Streamlit script for the web app.
- **homicide.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook where the EDA was conducted in detail.
- **streamlit Dashboard**: The interactive Power BI dashboard, which is accessible through the following [link to the deployed web app](https://osinachi-United-States-Homicide-Cases.hf.space/). Feel free to explore the visualizations and insights shared through the dashboard.
- **homicide-dashoard.jpg**: This is how the dashboard looks like.

## Results
After completing the EDA, I developed a web application using Python and Streamlit to provide an interactive platform where users can explore the findings and gain further insights into the dataset. You can access the deployed web app through the provided [link to the deployed web app](https://osinachi-United-States-Homicide-Cases.hf.space/), where the results of the EDA and the visualizations are available for exploration.

I have also documented the findings and insights from the EDA in a Medium publication. You can access this publication via this [link](https://ezembaosinachi.medium.com/delving-into-homicides-in-the-united-states-a-data-driven-exploration-bb68b277f599). In my Medium article, I share visualizations, interesting patterns, and valuable insights that I discovered during the analysis.

## Conclusion
The EDA process is integral to understanding the underlying trends and patterns within a dataset. This project not only showcased the power of EDA but also highlighted the ability to translate these insights into an interactive web application, making the findings easily accessible to users.
