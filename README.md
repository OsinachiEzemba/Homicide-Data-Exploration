# Homicide-Data-Exploration




## Overview
In this project, I have conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to homicide cases in the United States. EDA is a crucial step in understanding and gaining insights from data.

## Dataset Selection
I chose a specific dataset that piqued my interest. The details of the dataset, including its source and content, can be found in the project repository.

## Tools and Methods
For this project, the following tools and methods were utilized:

- **Tool of Choice**: Microsoft Power BI for data analysis and visualization.

- **Exploration Techniques**: I applied various data exploration techniques, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and data cleaning, to better understand the dataset.

## Project Files
This project repository contains the following key files:

- **homicide-data.csv**: This is the dataset we analyzed for our EDA.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: You can access the interactive Power BI dashboard by following this [link](https://app.powerbi.com/links/nQHepu1iwr?ctid=392ba85e-a1c8-4f5c-85ec-251bc6d10f96&pbi_source=linkShare). Feel free to explore the visualizations and insights.

## Results
I have documented the findings and insights from the EDA in a Medium publication. You can access this publication via this [link](https://ezembaosinachi.medium.com/delving-into-homicides-in-the-united-states-a-data-driven-exploration-bb68b277f599). In my Medium article, I share visualizations, interesting patterns, and valuable insights that I discovered during the analysis.

## Conclusion
Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in any data science project, as it helps  understand the dataset's characteristics and uncover valuable information. This project aimed to showcase the EDA process and its benefits using the chosen dataset.
